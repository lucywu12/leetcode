I ran into a couple of compilation errors initially, but I eventually figured it out.
I malloced arrays since you can't really initialize an array of n in C++,
but I wonder if there are other ways to solve this.
There were also faster runtimes, but I wonder if this had to do with malloc as well
or if there is something else I can try.
